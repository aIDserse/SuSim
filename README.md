# SuSim
SuSim! A Simula (not COBOL, not Fortran) calculator!<br>
This new version of the SuS series is written in Simula (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula)
For the fact that Simula does not comprend Inputs, you have to modify variables (a and b) from the .sim file, that can be edited with any text editor
# 5 functions
+, -, x, :, and sqrt<br>
More will be added in the future
You can use my code for inspiration, and contact me if you have Simula tips and Tricks ;)
